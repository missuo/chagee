## Disclaimer

This project is not intended for you to fraudulently obtain Chagee's drinks for free. Instead, Chagee has very strict and mandatory requirements for using meal codes to pick up orders, which I find very unreasonable and constitutes a serious lack of trust in consumers.

In any country around the world, I have never been asked to show a meal pickup code when ordering at **McDonald's**, **KFC**, **Starbucks**, and other chain stores. Even places like **A Little**, **MiXueBingCheng**, **Goodme** and **ChaBaidao** in mainland China do not require showing a meal pickup code.

I just want to tell Chagee through this project, if someone wants to cheat you out of your drinks, the way you are doing things won't prevent it at all. It will only bring more trouble to consumers, and this is completely unnecessary behavior.
