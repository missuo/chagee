## Disclaimer

This project is not intended for you to fraudulently obtain Chagee's drinks for free. Instead, Chagee has very strict and mandatory requirements for using meal codes to pick up orders, which I find very unreasonable and constitutes a serious lack of trust in consumers.

In any country around the world, I have never been asked to show a meal pickup code when ordering at McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks, and other chain stores. Even places like Yi Dian Dian, Meixue Bingcheng, and Cha Baidao in mainland China do not require showing a meal pickup code.

This program I just want to tell Chagee that if you want to scam your drinks, you can't avoid it at all in this way. It will only cause more trouble for the consumer and it's completely unnecessary behavior.
